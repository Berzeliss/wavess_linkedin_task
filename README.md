## Assumptions and Constraints
- LinkedIn API is restricted for general users, therefore, all the collected data is publically visible.
- Audience **sample** of users(Reactors/Commentators) and not the full audience.
- The Project prioritizes **business relevance** over prediction accuracy.
- Job roles and company types are gathered from profile titles and company information.
- Engagement performance is analysed using reactions(likes) and comments.
